A simple fitness tracking web app. It utilizes a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and it handles routes with Express. 

With it you will be able to:

  * Add exercises to the most recent workout plan.

  * Add new exercises to a new workout plan.

  * View the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.

  * View the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.

You can view the deployed app on [Heroku](https://motorobotofittrack.herokuapp.com).
